# FoundryVTT - MobileCompanion
A responsive WebApp to be used alongside [FoundryWebAPI](https://github.com/ricardopiloto/foundryvtt-webapi).

# What it does?
This app is readOnly at the moment, since messing direclty with the DB files is not a good idea.
Original idea here was to have means of reading the database files without the need to open the application, so I thought about creating a WebApp to do so.

# Important note
I am no developer, I'm learning as I go. Any help is welcome.
This is a proof of concept, it might be dropped without any notice (depending on my free time to adjust/learn and develop).
